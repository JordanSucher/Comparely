# Comparely

In b2b SaaS, keeping tabs on the competition is an existential need. Sure, there is discourse over how much to base decisions around what competitors are doing - but if your biggest competitor rolls out a new product line, you want to know about it.

This cuts across teams. Sales needs to speak to competitors on calls. Marketing needs to design relative positioning. Product needs to advocate for (and against!) roadmap items based on where others in the market are now and where they are going.

A surprising amount of this can be gleaned from public information. Take in a company’s site, tweets linkedin posts, articles about them on techcrunch, interviews with the founders, jobs the company is hiring for, reviews on the company’s software, and you can get a pretty solid picture of what the company’s priorities, strengths, and weaknesses are.

Comparely is a proof of concept exploring how automation & AI might be used to give b2b teams better telemetry on what is happening in the market.

The idea: pull data on a recurring basis, synthesize it with LLMs, and automatically notify stakeholders of anything important. This poc implements a basic feature comparison, but the potential to provide deeper insights is there.
